# Ai_News

AI News Summarizer is a Python-based project that automatically fetches the latest financial or company-related news articles, cleans and preprocesses the data, and generates concise AI summaries using a trained transformer model.

This project currently runs as a console-based pipeline, and a web interface will be added in the next stage.
